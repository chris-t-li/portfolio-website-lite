Welcome to my portfolio website - lightweight version!

Deployed using GitHub Pages: https://chris-t-li.github.io/portfolio-website-lite/

Goals: 
* Simple & Clean - purpose is to provide links to my socials, a brief intro and showcase recent projects. If you want to get to know me, I'm very open to face to face and virtual conversations!
* Lightweight - did I really need a React App for a personal website? How many of those node modules do I really need? (These are rhetorical questions)
* Space - total website is ~ 14MB (compared to prev version which was 200MB+)

Borrowed pieces:
* Design: HTML5 UP https://html5up.net
* Pictures: unsplash https://unsplash.com/ (other than the image of my face)
* Font: Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
* Icons: Devicons https://github.com/devicons/devicon
