Welcome to my portfolio website - lightweight version!

Goals: 
* Simple & Clean - purpose is to provide links to my socials, a brief about me section and show case recent projects. If you want to get to know me more, I'm very open to face to face and virtual conversations as opposed to writing excessively about myself on a website.
* Lightweight - did I really need a React App for a personal website? How many of those node modules do I really need? (These are rhetorical questions)
* Space - total website is ~ 14MB (compared to prev version which was 200MB+)

Borrowed pieces:
* Design: HTML5 UP https://html5up.net
* Pictures: unsplash https://unsplash.com/ (other than the image of my face)
* Font: Font Awesome https://fontawesome.com/
* Icons: Devicons https://github.com/devicons/devicon
